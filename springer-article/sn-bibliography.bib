  abstract = {The N-Queens problem is a commonly used example in computer science. There are numerous approaches proposed to solve the problem. We introduce several definitions of the problem, and review some of the algorithms. We classify the algorithms for the N-Queens problem into 3 categories. The first category comprises the algorithms generating all the solutions for a given N. The algorithms in the second category are desinged to generate only the fundamental solutions [34]. The algorithms in the last category generate only one or several solutions but not necessarily all of them.},
